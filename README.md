# PDFtool
Python program created to transpose a message into a template PDF

INFO:
Ideally, you have a blank pdf template (i.e. letterhead) file and you use this python program to transponse messages on to it. 
We'll use the fpdf2 library for this purpose as it's simple to use and doesn't require many dependencies.
